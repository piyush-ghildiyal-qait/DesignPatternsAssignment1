     Q-1)    The general purpose of the Singleton pattern is to:
             a) Ensure that no more than one instance of a class exists.
             b) Ensure that only one instance of a class exists at the same time.
             c) Separate objects in a single class from objects in another class.
             d) Control creation of objects in a single class or another class.

Answer-1) (a) Ensure that no more than one instance of a class exists.

          Explaination-  The Singleton pattern ensures that no more than one instance of the class exists ever.
                         It does not allow one instance of the Singleton to be destroyed and then another one created.
                         In general, a Singleton has nothing to do with separating objects in different classes.
                         A Singleton does control creation of objects, but not in a single or another class.
   
     Q-2)    Which of the following is true about Singleton class?
            a) The class has only a single member method.
            b) The class has only a single field.
            c) The class should have exactly one instance.
            d) The class cannot be sub-classed.


Answer-2) (c) The class should have exactly one instance.

          Explaination -  Although many of the examples in a module can used classes with only a single static field,
                      in more specific cases the class can have many different static and instance fields and methods and still be a Singleton. 
                         The single in Singleton refers to the number of instances of the class, not the number of fields or methods in the
                         class. D is incorrect because Singleton classes can be subclassed.
